Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspectsof modern life such as healthcare

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1:The development of programmimg languages         3:The advent of structured programming
2:Establishment of software engineering
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 -Requirement:Gathering and documenting user needsand sysytem requirements           -Design:Creating detailed designs of the software architecture
 -Implementation:Writing code according to the design specifications                 -Testing:Conducting various tests to ensure softaware meets quality standards              -Deployment:Releasing software to the users                                        -Maintenance:Providing ongoing support,updates to the software user after deployment
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and Agile guide the software development process.Waterfall sequential approach with distinct phases eg,(requirements,design) while Agile focuses on flexibility,collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.A Software Developer writes code and implements software solutions                                                                                                          2.Quality Assuarance Engineer ensures quality by designing and executing test plans                                                                                            3.Project Manager oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code(eg;Visual studios,Eclipse)                                                                           VCS provide software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordonate work among team members(eg;Git,Subversion)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements,Technical debt and Tight deadlines.You can overcome this by effective communcation,prioritizing of tasks,agile methodologies and regular reassesment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing:testing individuals components            Integration testing:testing interactions between differrent components                                                 System testing:testing the entire software system       Acceptance testing:testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs                           Testing helps to identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to higher quality software products

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is crafting questions to get the best responses from AI models.Prompt Engineering avoids the occurence of getting a confusing answer by making questions clear and specific

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:Tell me about cars          Imroved prompt:Tell me different types of cars and their specifications                                                              Improved prompt will help the user to get amore focused response.
